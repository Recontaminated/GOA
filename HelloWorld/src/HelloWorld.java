 *  These 14 lines of text are comments. They are not part of the code;
 *  they are here as a note to the reader of the program. 
 *      The first 3 lines tell the reader who, when, and why
 *      The next line describes the big picture purpose of the program. 
 *
 *  We will always include such lines in our programs
